# AWS Lambda Client (alc)

  * Focus remove unnecessary boilerplate from your development process
  * Ease-of-use with the [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/)

## Philosophy

The alc philosophy is to provide a self evident tool for use with the amazon lambdas.

The alc encourages you to use small, internally routed API lambdas in a normalized OOP way.

In addition, it makes this like routing and validating API requests less cumbersome and time consuming.
